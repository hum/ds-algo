# Exercises

This is a list of short exercises for reference and a bit of problem solving. Feel free to check the solutions as well if you get stuck.

### Problem 1
Given 2 sorted arrays (slices), merge them into eachother while keeping the final array sorted.

In:
```go
array1 = [0, 3, 4, 31]
array2 = [4, 6, 30]
```
Out:
```go
result = [0, 3, 4, 4, 6, 30, 31]
```

### Problem 2
Reverse a given string.

In:
```go
s = "Hello, my name is..."
```
Out:
```go
result = "...si eman ym ,olleH"
```

### Problem 3
Given a non-sorted array, find the first recurring number. If no such pair exists, return an error.

In:
```go
array = [2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 2, 4]
```
Out:
```go

```
