# Data Structures and Algorithms

This is just a repository for having a unified reference for data structures and algorithms on hand. There are no runnable files per se, only test files to test the functionality of the implementations.

There's also a few [exercises](https://github.com/hum/ds-algo/tree/go/exercises) - solutions included.
